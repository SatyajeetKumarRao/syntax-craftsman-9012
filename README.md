# Basket Blend

## Introduction
My project, a BigBasket clone, is designed to replicate the functionality of the popular online grocery shopping platform. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, along with modules like json-server and json-server-auth, I created a web application where users can browse through various products, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout.

The main purpose of this project was to apply the coding and testing skills I've learned during my journey at Masai School. By building a practical project like this, I aimed to solidify my understanding of web development concepts and enhance my proficiency in using different technologies. Through hands-on experience, I gained insights into front-end and back-end development processes, including data management and authentication. This project serves as a testament to my learning journey and showcases my ability to develop functional web applications.
